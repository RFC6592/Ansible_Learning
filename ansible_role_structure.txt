Roles Structure :

 1) Defaults: default variables with lowest
 precedence (e.g. port)
 
 2) Handlers: contains all handlers
 
 3) Meta: role metadata including
 dependencies to other roles
 
 4) Tasks: plays or tasks (main.yml)
 tip: it's common to include tasks in
 main.yml with "when" (e.g. OS == xyz)
 
 5) Templates: templates to deploy (e.g. vhost.conf.j2)
 
 6) Tests: place for playbook tests
 
 7) Vars: variables (e.g. override port)
